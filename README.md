#Final Project: 
It contains python code file and data file as garbage-classification.ipynb and GarbageClassification respectively.
Google Colab run:
The project can be run on google colab by placing both the given files at location where we are going to run the project. One can take it from google drive and access it on Google Colab directly by mounting the drive.
I have used data from my drive location.
Using GPU makes it run faster, therefore we may enable GPU for run.
Kaggle run:

It will run on data from Kaggle only.
